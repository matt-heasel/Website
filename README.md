H-Town Realty specializes in the master-planned community of the Woodlands, in theHouston, Texas metropolitan area. This is an extremely competitive market— It seems thatthere are hundreds of REALTORS™ in this community of less than 100,000.  H-Town Realtyfurther specializes in home rentals, which they hope will provide them a niche in the largermarket.

They want something that is beyond the standard real estate website, but something thatbrands them in the eyes of their clients and allows viewers to immediately express interestin a home that they are interested in. Speed is of the essence in this business and unlessH-Town Realty responds quickly, another real estate company might.

The target market for H-Town is the renter who is new to town, and likely being transferredfor work.  H-Town Clients tend to be couples (singles would likely rent a condominium orapartment). They also are likely to be young parents.  Some are trying out the Houston areabefore committing to buying a home.  The Woodlands is a large master-plannedcommunity with many amenities, the residents (and by extension your client’s targetmarket) tend to be middle to upper-middle-class professionals.

Websites are increasingly the most important tools that real estate agents have at theirdisposal.  This project is critical to their success and the client's expectation is that the levelof work you will produce is portfolio-worthy
